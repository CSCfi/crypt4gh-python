\section{Encrypted Representation Overview}
The encrypted file consists of five parts:

\begin{itemize}
\item An unencrypted header, containing a magic number, a version number, a public key along with its length (potentially zero), and the length of the encrypted header.
  %
\item An encrypted header, which is encrypted using an asymmetric encryption algorithm. 
  %
  It lists the checksum algorithm used, the encryption algorithm used, and the encryption key needed to decrypt the encrypted data portion.
  %
\item A 64-byte Ed25519 signature validating the encrypted header.
  %
\item The encrypted data.
  % 
  This is the actual application data.
  %
  It is encrypted using a symmetric encryption algorithm, as specified in the encrypted header.
  %
  The data is encrypted in 64 kilobytes segments. For each encrypted segment, a 12 bytes nonce is prepended and a 16 bytes MAC is appended.
  %
\item The checksum of the unencrypted data, if the checksum algorithm was listed in the encrypted header.
  %
\end{itemize}
